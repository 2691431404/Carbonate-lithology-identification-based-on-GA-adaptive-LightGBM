Carbonate lithology identification based on GA adaptive LightGBM

Program language: python
Software required: PyCharm Community Edition 2021

LightGBM is an efficient decision tree algorithm with the advantages of fast training speed, high accuracy and good scalability.
In the paper, the LightGBM hyperparameters are optimized using genetic algorithms and grid search methods. 
So that the LightGBM model can be adapted to different regional environments and can achieve good results
